MLNS Final Project: Bike Sharing Schemes Community Detection

## Introduction
Bicycle sharing schemes (BSS) have become an essential part of sustainable urban mobility, providing last-mile connectivity and complementing conventional modes of transportation. To improve BSS adoption and expand its reach, it is crucial to understand travel patterns and identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies. In this project, we propose a comprehensive and pervasive station-level characterization of the London BSS network using spatiotemporal utilisation features. Our methodology involves preprocessing the BSS rental data to extract relevant features, applying different algorithms and techniques to identify clusters of stations with similar travel patterns over two different periods. By visualizing the results of our approach, we identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the BSS network, providing insights that can inform decision-making and improve the sustainability and effectiveness of urban transportation systems.
